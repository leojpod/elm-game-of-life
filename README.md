# elm game of life!

This is a small game of life made with Elm to learn the language.
You can tag along on [medium](https://medium.com/@leojpod/) to see posts related to this "web-application".


Ideally I'd like to use this simple game to add complexity step by step until I tried all aspects of elm:

-   [x]  basics,
-   [x]  elm-mdl,
-   [ ]  server communication,
-   [ ]  firebase integration,
-   [ ]  navigation,
-   [ ]  ...
